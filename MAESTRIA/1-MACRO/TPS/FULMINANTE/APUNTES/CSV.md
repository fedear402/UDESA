### 4.2.7 | Sovereign wealth funds

This stylised model actually allows us to think of other simple policy responses. Imagine a country that has a finite stock of resources, like copper.⁴ Furthermore, let’s imagine that this stock of copper is being extracted in a way that it will disappear in a finite amount of time. The optimal program is to consume the net present value of the copper over the infinite future. So, as the stock of copper declines the economy should use those resources to accumulate other assets. This is the fiscal surplus rule implemented by Chile to compensate for the depletion of their resources. In fact, Chile also has a rule to identify transitory from permanent shocks, with the implication that all transitory increases (decreases) in the price level have to be saved (spent).

Does this provide a rationale for some other sovereign wealth funds? The discussion above suggests that a country should consume:

$$
r \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_t e^{-rt} \, dt, \tag{4.31}
$$

where $R$ is the value of the resources extracted in period $t$. This equation says that a country should value its intertemporal resources (which are the equivalent of the $a_0$ above, an initial stock of assets), and consume the real return on it.

Is that how actual sovereign funds work? Well, the **Norwegian** sovereign fund rule, for instance, does not do this. Their rule is to spend at time $t$ the real return of the assets accumulated until then:

$$
r \int_{-\infty}^{t} R_s e^{-r(s - t)} \, ds. \tag{4.32}
$$

This rule can only be rationalised if you expect no further discoveries and treat each new discovery as a surprise. Alternatively, one could assume that the future is very uncertain, so one does not want to commit debt ahead of time. (We will come back to this precautionary savings idea in our study of consumption in Chapter 11.) In any event, the key lesson is that studying our stylised models can help clarify the logic of existing policies, and where and why they depart from our basic assumptions.


### 18.1.8 | Smoothing government spending 

The opposite happens if there is a desire to smooth government spending over time. Consider, for example, a case where tax revenues are now exogenous, though maybe hit by exogenous shocks. This may capture important cases, such as those in which economies are heavily reliant on the proceeds from natural resources, on whose prices they may not have much influence. How should such an economy plan its spending profile? To discuss this question imagine the case of a country where the government maximises 
$$ \int_0^{\infty} \left( \frac{\sigma}{1 - \sigma} \right) g_t^{\sigma - 1} e^{-\rho t} dt, \tag{18.32} $$ subject to the budget constraint: $$ \dot{b}_t = rb_t + \tau_t + \varepsilon_t - g_t, \tag{18.33} $$ where $b$ stands for government assets, plus the NPG condition that we omit for brevity. Notice that this is identical to our standard consumption optimisation in an open economy, and therefore, we know that the government has a desire to smooth government expenditures over time. We assume, though, that the shock to income $\varepsilon_t$ follows: $$ \varepsilon_t = \varepsilon_0 e^{-\delta t}. \tag{18.34} $$ This embeds a full range of cases — for instance, if $\delta \to \infty$ then we have a purely transitory shock, but if $\delta \to 0$, the shock would be permanent. Assuming, for simplicity, as we've done before, that $\rho = r$, the FOC for this problem is $\dot{g} = 0$: it is now government spending that should remain constant over time. This means that $$ g = r \left[ b_0 + \frac{\tau}{r} + \frac{\varepsilon_0}{r + \delta} \right]. \tag{18.35} $$ Notice that the final two terms give the present discounted value of taxes and of the income shock. Using (18.33) in (18.35) (and allowing $b_0 = 0$): $$ \dot{b}_t = \frac{\delta}{r + \delta} \varepsilon_t. \tag{18.36} $$ Notice that if the shock is permanent ($\delta = 0$), the change in debt is zero, and government spending adjusts immediately to its new level. If shocks are transitory and positive, then the government accumulates assets along the converging path. **Implication**: If the government wants to smooth its consumption, it will actually decrease its expenditures when hit by a negative shock. How persistent the shock is determines the impact on government expenditures. In other words, the desire to smooth this response somewhat weakens the countercyclical results we have discussed above.

### The Caballero model 

Caballero (1990) provides a nice example that allows for a simple solution. Consider the case of a constant absolute risk aversion function: $$ u(c_t) = -\frac{1}{\theta} e^{-\theta c_t}. \tag{12.29} $$ Assuming that the interest rate is equal to the discount rate for simplification, this problem has a traditional Euler equation of the form: $$ e^{-\theta c_t} = E_t \left[ e^{-\theta c_{t+1}} \right]. \tag{12.30} $$ Caballero proposes a solution of the form: $$ c_{t+1} = \Gamma_t + c_t + \nu_{t+1}, \tag{12.31} $$ where $\nu$ is related to the shock to income, the source of uncertainty in the model. Replacing in the Euler equation gives: $$ e^{-\theta c_t} = E_t \left[ e^{-\theta (\Gamma_t + c_t + \nu_{t+1})} \right], \tag{12.32} $$ which, taking logs, simplifies to: $$ \theta \Gamma_t = \log E_t \left[ e^{-\theta \nu_{t+1}} \right]. \tag{12.33} $$ If $\nu \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\nu^2)$, then we can use the fact that $E e^x = e^{E x + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}}$ to find the value of $\Gamma$ (as the value is constant, we can do away with the subscript) in (12.33): $$ \theta \Gamma = \log \left[ e^{\frac{\theta^2 \sigma_\nu^2}{2}} \right], \tag{12.34} $$ or, simply, $$ \Gamma = \frac{\theta \sigma_\nu^2}{2}. \tag{12.35} $$ This is a very simple expression. It says that even when the interest rate equals the discount rate the consumption profile is upward sloping. The higher the variance, the higher the slope. The precautionary savings hypothesis is also useful to capture other stylised facts: families tend to show an upward-sloping consumption path while the uncertainties of their labour life get sorted out. Eventually, they reach a point where consumption stabilises and they accumulate assets. Gourinchas and Parker (2002) describe these dynamics. Roughly the pattern that emerges is that families have an increasing consumption pattern until sometime in the early 30s, after which consumption starts to flatten.
