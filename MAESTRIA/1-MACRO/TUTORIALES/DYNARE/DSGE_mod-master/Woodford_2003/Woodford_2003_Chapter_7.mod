/*
 * This file implements the deterministic optimal policy exercise in Figure 7.1 of Michael Woodford (2003): "Interest and prices",
 * Princeton University Press, page 476. The same figure is reproduced as Figure 2 in Michael Woodford (2010): "Optimal Monetary Stabilization
 *  Policy", Chapter 14 of the Handbook of Monetary Economics, Volume 3B, Elsevier
 *
 * The mod-file demonstrates how to use the ramsey_model-command to let Dynare generate the stationary Ramsey first order conditions
 * in order to conduct Ramsey policy from a timeless perspective (set Ramsey_policy_timeless=1). If Ramsey_policy_t0_optimal
 * it uses the t_0 optimal Ramsey policy where the initial multiplier is set to 0.
 * 
 * THIS MOD-FILE REQUIRES DYNARE 4.5 OR HIGHER
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - In contrast to what is stated in the article, the parameterization used for Figure 2 is not the one given in Woodford (2003).
 *      While Figure 7.1 is identical to Figure 2, the parameterization is the one used in Woodford (1999), i.e. lambda=0.003 instead of 0.048
 *  - The inflation rate in the Figure is the annualized inflation rate
 *
 * This implementation was written by Johannes Pfeifer. In case you spot mistakes,
 * email me at jpfeifer@gmx.de
 *
 * Please note that the following copyright notice only applies to this Dynare 
 * implementation of the model.
