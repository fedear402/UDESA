 * a necessary one. It would only be a necessary condition if it were conducted on a 
 * minimal state space. However, Dynare generally does not rely on a minimal state space,
 * but may augment it for computational purposes. For details, see e.g. Komunjer/Ng (2011):
 * "Dynamic Identification of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models", Econometrica, 79(6), 1995â€“2032.
