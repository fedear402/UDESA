## Overlapping generations models
### Adding individual savings decisions

### Why study these models

- The savings rate $s$ is no longer a constant
- It is determined by choices of individuals
- These models are sometimes included inside RBC models
  - for example, in models where collateral is needed to borrow to buy capital
  - where you want people to have a finite life or probability of death
- Useful models: a large literature uses these models
  - education
  - growth
  - assets holding and money
  - retirement

## The Environment

- Time is discrete: $t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \infty$
- Individuals live 2 periods (smallest number to have a "future")
  - Generation $t$ is born in period $t$, new generation in $t + 1$
  - Lives in periods $t$ and $t + 1$
  - They are dead in periods $t + 2$ and onwards
  - There are $N(t)$ members of generation $t$
- Individuals have preferences: person $h$ of generation $t$

$$u_t^h(c_t^h(t), c_t^h(t + 1))$$

- Individuals have a labor endowment:
  - today, no labor supply decision, as a simplification, they supply all
  
$$h_t^h = [h_t^h(t), h_t^h(t + 1)]$$

  - our future models will have both consumption and labor decisions


---

## The Environment (continued)

- Production technology (constant returns to scale)

$$Y(t) = F(K(t), H(t))$$

- Total labor supplied in period $t$

$$H(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} h_t^h(t) + \sum_{h=1}^{N(t-1)} h_{t-1}^h(t)$$

Useful to define labor supplied by each generation in period $t$

$$H_t(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} h_t^h(t) \quad H_{t-1}(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t-1)} h_{t-1}^h(t)$$

---

## Feasibility constraint

Feasibility constraint for period $t$ (assume that all $K(t)$ depreciates in period $t$)

$$Y(t) = F(K(t), H(t)) \geq \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} c_t^h(t) + \sum_{h=1}^{N(t-1)} c_{t-1}^h(t) + K(t + 1)$$

- how would this change if not all capital depreciates?
- if only $\delta K(t)$ depreciates, the old could sell the $(1 - \delta) K(t)$ that remains to young
- what would the price of the old capital be?
- How do budget constraints of young and old change?

---

## The economy (a market economy)

**Budget constraint of a member $h$ of generation $t$ when young**

$$w_t h_t^h(t) = c_t^h(t) + l^h(t) + k^h(t + 1)$$

- $w_t$ are the wages paid at time $t$
- $k^h(t + 1)$ is their savings in the form of capital for use in period $t + 1$
- $l^h(t)$ is lending or borrowing (if negative) of young in period $t$
- Can only lend to own generation (why?)
- so an equilibrium condition is

$$0 = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} l^h(t)$$

**Budget constraint of member $h$ generation $t$ when old**

$$c_t^h(t + 1) = w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1) + r_t l^h(t) + rental_{t+1} k^h(t + 1)$$

- $r_t$ is the interest rate on private loans
- $rental_{t+1}$ is the rental rate on capital when it is being used
- here we assume that capital depreciates 100% in the period of use

## Factor market conditions

**Perfectly competitive factor markets**

So, if firms maximize profits, we get the conditions that

$$w_t = F_H(K(t), H(t))$$

and

$$rental_t = F_K(K(t), H(t))$$

**Factor rentals equal their marginal products**

---

## Lifetime budget constraint and Arbitrage conditions

**Combine the two budget constraints through $l_h(t)$**. Assume perfect foresight (not reasonable but easy to do). **The lifetime budget constraint is**

$$c_t^h(t) + \frac{c_t^h(t + 1)}{r_t} = w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1)}{r_t} - k^h(t + 1) \left[1 - \frac{rental_{t+1}}{r_t}\right]$$

**In perfect foresight economy, all assets have same risk (none, that is what perfect foresight implies) so must have same return (for both to be held)**

---

## Lifetime budget constraint and Arbitrage conditions (continued)

**Arbitrage condition (actually NO arbitrage condition)**

$$rental_{t+1} = r_t$$

- **What if not true:** two options $rental_{t+1} < r_t$ or $rental_{t+1} > r_t$
- **If $rental_{t+1} < r_t$**
  - Everyone wants to lend and no one holds capital
  - But marginal product of capital $\to \infty$ when $K(t) \to 0$
  - Not an equilibrium (no demand)
- **If $rental_{t+1} > r_t$**
  - Everyone wants to borrow an infinite amount to buy capital
  - This can't be an equilibrium (no supply)
- **Only $rental_{t+1} = r_t$ remains as possibility**

---

## Lifetime budget constraint II

**Given that**

$$rental_{t+1} = r_t$$

**The lifetime budget constraint simplifies to**

$$c_t^h(t) + \frac{c_t^h(t + 1)}{r_t} = w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1)}{r_t}$$

**The present value of lifetime consumption equals the present value of lifetime wage income**

---

## Definition of an equilibrium

A **competitive equilibrium** is a sequence of prices, $\{w_t, rental_t, r_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$, and quantities, $\{\{c_t^h(t)\}_{h=1}^{N(t)}, \{c_{t-1}^h(t)\}_{h=1}^{N(t-1)}, K(t + 1)\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$, such that

each member $h$ of each generation $t > 0$ maximizes the utility function,

$$u_t^h(c_t^h(t), c_t^h(t + 1))$$

subject to the lifetime budget constraint,

$$c_t^h(t) + \frac{c_t^h(t + 1)}{r_t} = w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1)}{r_t}$$

and the equilibrium conditions,

$$r_t = rental_{t+1}$$
$$w_t = F_H(K(t), H(t))$$
$$rental_t = F_K(K(t), H(t))$$
$$H(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} h_t^h(t) + \sum_{h=1}^{N(t-1)} h_{t-1}^h(t)$$
$$K(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t-1)} k_{t-1}^h(t)$$

hold in every period.

## How to solve: Individual problem

**Substitute the lifetime budget constraint into the utility function to get**

$$\max_{c_t^h(t)} u(c_t^h(t), r_t w_t h_t^h(t) + w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1) - r_t c_t^h(t))$$

**First order conditions are**

$$u_1(c_t^h(t), r_t w_t h_t^h(t) + w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1) - r_t c_t^h(t)) = r_t u_2(c_t^h(t), r_t w_t h_t^h(t) + w_{t+1} h_t^h(t + 1) - r_t c_t^h(t))$$

**One can solve for a savings functions as**

$$s_t^h(w_t, w_{t+1}, r_t) = l^h(t) + k^h(t + 1)$$

**Note:** from budget constraint when young, $s_t^h = w_t h_t^h(t) - c_t^h(t)$ and $h_t^h(t)$ and $h_t^h(t + 1)$ are given

## How to solve economy: Aggregating savings functions

**Sum savings across members of generation $t$:**

$$S_t(\cdot) \equiv \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} s_t^h(\cdot) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} l^h(t) + \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} k^h(t + 1)$$

**In equilibrium, total borrowing and lending among generation $t$ is**

$$\sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} l^h(t) = 0$$

**Definition of aggregate capital is**

$$K(t + 1) = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} k^h(t + 1)$$

**So the aggregate savings equation is**

$$S_t(w_t, w_{t+1}, r_t) = K(t + 1)$$

---

## How to solve: Getting a first order difference equation

**From the factor markets we have wages and rentals in terms of capital and labor,**

$$w_t = F_H(K(t), H(t))$$
$$rental_t = F_K(K(t), H(t))$$

**Substitute these into the aggregate saving equation to get (this ugly equation)**

$$S_t(F_H(K(t), H(t)), F_H(K(t+1), H(t+1)), F_K(K(t+1), H(t+1))) = K(t + 1)$$

**This can be simplified (since $H(t)$ and $H(t + 1)$ are constants) to get a function of the form**

$$K(t + 1) = G(K(t))$$

**Given some initial $K(0)$, the time path of the economy can be found by repeatedly applying this equation**

---

## An example economy

**Let the utility function be**

$$u_t^h = u(c_t^h(t), c_t^h(t + 1)) = c_t^h(t) c_t^h(t + 1)^{\beta}$$

**and the production function be**

$$Y_t = F(K(t), H(t)) = K(t)^{\theta} H(t)^{1-\theta}$$

**After a bunch of algebra,**

$$K(t + 1) = G(K(t)) = \frac{\theta \beta \frac{H_t(t)}{H(t)^{\theta}} }{ \left[\frac{H_t(t+1)}{H(t+1)}\right]  + \frac{\theta(1+\beta)}{(1-\theta)} } K(t)^{\theta} = \kappa K(t)^{\theta}$$

where $\kappa$ is a constant that depends on parameters and exogenous things. It is a function of decisons made by people. Unlike the solow model.

$$\kappa = \frac{\theta \beta \frac{H_t(t)}{H(t)^{\theta}} }{ \left[\frac{H_t(t+1)}{H(t+1)}\right]  + \frac{\theta(1+\beta)}{(1-\theta)} }$$


**The book contains an example of how to make the model stochastic.** Where we have $r(t + 1)$, $w(t + 1)$, and $H(t + 1)$ we need to replace them by their expectations, $E_t r(t + 1)$, $E_t w(t + 1)$, and $E_t H(t + 1)$, which will depend on the stochastic process of the technology shock.
