# Exercise 1
**Find the equilibrium in a constant population economy where, in each period, the government imposes a small lump sum tax, $\tau$, on each young person and gives that amount to each old person. Both the young and the old see these taxes as lump sum. Under what conditions can this tax improve welfare and under what conditions will it not?**

The budget constraints are modified to look like this:
$$
w_{t} h_{t}^{h} (t) = c_{t}^{h} (t) + l^{h} (t) + k^{h}(t+1) + \tau
$$
So some of their total labor income will now have to go to pay the tax $\tau$. Meanwhile, old people will be receiving that tax so the budget constraint in the next period is:
$$
w_{t+1} h_{t}^{h} (t+1) + r_{t} l^{h}(t) + \text{rental} _{t+1} k^{h}(t+1)  + \tau = c_{t}^{h} (t+1)
$$
On the left we have their income in period $t+1$ of a member of generation $t$. We can see that they have more income than in the basic model which implies the old will consume more and the young will consume less. Intuitively, with a simple utility function increasing in consumption, we would expect welfare to improve if more old people can consume more than the forgone consumption of the young to play taxes. 
We can express the restriction in  period $t$ of generation $t$ of the young in terms of loans $l^{h}$: 
 $$
l^{h} (t) = w_{t} h_{t}^{h} (t) - c_{t}^{h} (t) - k^{h}(t+1) - \tau 
$$
We replace that in the second constraint, that of the second period of generation $t$.
$$
w_{t+1} h_{t}^{h} (t+1) + r_{t}  (w_{t} h_{t}^{h} (t) - c_{t}^{h} (t) - k^{h}(t+1) - \tau )+ \text{rental} _{t+1} k^{h}(t+1)  + \tau = c_{t}^{h} (t+1)
$$
We can now impose the no-arbitrage condition, which says that, in this closed economy with perfect foresight, $\text{rental}_{t+1}=r_{t}$. That follows from the Inada conditions we assumed on the production function, by which if the equality doesn't hold either no one wants to borrow and holds no capital ($\text{rental}_{t+1}<r_{t}$) or no one lends and everybody wants capital  ($\text{rental}_{t+1}>r_{t}$) . We then also divide through by $r_{t}$ and get to this expression:
$$
\frac{w_{t+1}h_{t}^{h}(t+1)}{r_{t}} + w_{t} h_{t}^{h} (t) - c_{t}^{h} (t) - k^{h}(t+1) - \tau +  k^{h}(t+1)  + \frac{\tau}{r_{t}} = \frac{c_{t}^{h}(t+1)}{r_{t}}
$$
The terms next period $k^{h}$ cancel out and we can rearrange to get:
$$
\frac{w_{t+1}h_{t}^{h}(t+1)}{r_{t}} + w_{t} h_{t}^{h} (t) + \tau ( \frac{1}{r_{t}}-1) = \frac{c_{t}^{h}(t+1)}{r_{t}} +  c_{t}^{h} (t)
$$
That is the usual intertemporal constraint. The term $\tau ( \frac{1}{r_{t}}-1)$ only appears in this specification, so we can check whether intertempral consumption rises relative to the model without tax if that term is positive.
$$
\tau ( \frac{1}{r_{t}}-1) \geq 0 \implies r_{t} \leq 1
$$
So if $r_{t} \leq 1$, the tax improves welfare. We interpret that if the rate of return of the economy $r$ is too low, lower than the return of just leaving the government to give your money back later (because $\tau$ and population are constant), then the best use of money is that lump sum transfer. If that was not the case, it would be better to take advantage of the high rate of return in the economy rather than pay tax.

# Exercise 2
 **Solve the model of the class but where depreciation is equal to $\delta < 1$, for example, $\delta = .5$. Will output in the stationary state be higher or lower? Will the utility of households in the stationary state be higher or lower? Starting from some $K_0$ below the stationary state, will growth be faster or slower?**

Now, for the capital that they saved in the fist period $k^{h}(t+1)$ in order to earn a rate $\text{rental}_{t+1}$ later, now also a proportion of that saved capital materializes later, namely $(1-\delta)k^{h}(t+1)$, the proportion that didn't fully depreciate. 

The constraints will be these:
$$
w_{t} h_{t}^{h} (t) = c_{t}^{h} (t) + l^{h} (t) + k^{h}(t+1) 
$$
That one, that of the young, is the same as always. The old will face this constraint:
$$
w_{t+1} h_{t}^{h} (t+1) + r_{t} l^{h}(t) + \text{rental} _{t+1} k^{h}(t+1)  + (1-\delta)k^{h}(t+1) = c_{t}^{h} (t+1)
$$
which means they sell some of the remaining capital to the young, which is an additional income for the old and means there will be more capital going around in the economy. Intuitively, we would expect this to improve output and household utility realtive to the model with full depreciation. There is more stuff!
We can also express this as:
$$
w_{t+1} h_{t}^{h} (t+1) + r_{t} l^{h}(t) + (1+\text{rental} _{t+1}-\delta)k^{h}(t+1) = c_{t}^{h} (t+1)
$$
and there we have the term $(1+\text{rental} _{t+1}-\delta)$ which would represent something like the effective return on capital, and tha is now equal to $r$, the rate on loans, through no arbitrage.For equilibrium in both lending and capital markets:
$$r_t = 1+\text{rental} _{t+1}-\delta$$
And since $\text{rental} _{t+1} = F_K(K(t), H(t))$, (from perfect competition) it follows that:
$$r_t = F_K(K(t+1), H(t+1)) + (1-\delta)$$
To analyze the stationary state and dynamics, we will take the example economy with Cobb Douglass production and utility.


Following similar steps as in the full depreciation case but accounting for remaining capital:

$$K(t+1) = \frac{\theta \beta \frac{H_t(t)}{H(t)^{\theta}}}{\frac{H_{t-1}(t+1)}{H(t+1)} + \frac{\theta(1+\beta)}{(1-\theta) + (1-\delta)}} K(t)^{\theta} + (1-\delta)K(t)$$

**STEADY STATE**

In steady state where $K(t+1) = K(t) = K^*$:

$$K^* = \kappa' (K^*)^{\theta} + (1-\delta)K^*$$

where $\kappa' = \frac{\theta \beta \frac{H_t}{H^{\theta}}}{\frac{H_{t-1}}{H} + \frac{\theta(1+\beta)}{(1-\theta) + (1-\delta)}}$

Solving for $K^*$:
$$\delta K^* = \kappa' (K^*)^{\theta}$$
$$(K^*)^{1-\theta} = \frac{\kappa'}{\delta}$$
$$K^* = \left(\frac{\kappa'}{\delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\theta}}$$

### 6. Comparison with Full Depreciation

**Result 1: Higher Steady-State Capital**
- With $\delta = 0.5 < 1$, the steady-state capital stock $K^*$ is higher
- This occurs for two reasons:
  1. $\kappa' > \kappa$ (the coefficient is larger due to reduced effective discount rate)
  2. Division by $\delta < 1$ further increases the steady-state level

**Result 2: Higher Steady-State Output**
- Since $Y^* = (K^*)^{\theta} H^{1-\theta}$ and $K^*$ is higher
- Steady-state output $Y^*$ is higher with partial depreciation

**Result 3: Higher Steady-State Utility**
- More output means more resources for consumption
- Both young and old consume more in steady state
- Steady-state utility is higher

### 7. Growth Dynamics from $K_0 < K^*$

The growth rate of capital is:
$$\frac{K(t+1) - K(t)}{K(t)} = \frac{\kappa' K(t)^{\theta-1} + (1-\delta) - 1}{1} = \kappa' K(t)^{\theta-1} - \delta$$

**Result 4: Faster Initial Growth**
- Starting from $K_0$ below steady state, growth is faster with partial depreciation
- The $(1-\delta)K(t)$ term means more capital carries forward each period
- This accelerates capital accumulation when below steady state
- As $K(t) \to K^*$, growth slows and converges to zero

## Detailed Derivation of Capital Accumulation with Partial Depreciation

For member $h$ of generation $t$ with utility function $u_t^h = c_t^h(t) \cdot [c_t^h(t+1)]^\beta$
Subject to:
$w_t h_t^h(t) = c_t^h(t) + l^h(t) + k^h(t+1)$
$c_t^h(t+1) = w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1) + r_t l^h(t) + \text{rental}_{t+1} k^h(t+1) + (1-\delta)k^h(t+1)$

Substituting the arbitrage condition into the old-age budget constraint:
$$c_t^h(t+1) = w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1) + r_t l^h(t) + r_t k^h(t+1)$$
And from there we ge the lifetime budget constraint exactly like before because the rates cancel out:
$$c_t^h(t) + \frac{c_t^h(t+1)}{r_t} = w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1)}{r_t}$$

Maximizing $u_t^h = c_t^h(t) \cdot [c_t^h(t+1)]^\beta$ subject to the lifetime budget constraint:

$$\mathcal{L} = c_t^h(t) \cdot [c_t^h(t+1)]^\beta + \lambda\left[w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1)}{r_t} - c_t^h(t) - \frac{c_t^h(t+1)}{r_t}\right]$$

FOCs:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_t^h(t)}: [c_t^h(t+1)]^\beta - \lambda = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_t^h(t+1)}: \beta c_t^h(t)[c_t^h(t+1)]^{\beta-1} - \frac{\lambda}{r_t} = 0$$

From these: $\frac{c_t^h(t+1)}{c_t^h(t)} = \beta r_t$. Now, using $c_t^h(t+1) = \beta r_t c_t^h(t)$ in the lifetime budget constraint:
$$c_t^h(t) + \frac{\beta r_t c_t^h(t)}{r_t} = w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1)}{r_t}$$

$$c_t^h(t)(1 + \beta) = w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1)}{r_t}$$

$$c_t^h(t) = \frac{1}{1+\beta}\left[w_t h_t^h(t) + \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1)}{r_t}\right]$$

Savings when young:
$$s_t^h = w_t h_t^h(t) - c_t^h(t) = \frac{\beta w_t h_t^h(t) - \frac{w_{t+1} h_t^h(t+1)}{r_t}}{1+\beta}$$


Total savings of generation $t$ (summing up all the terms with an $h$ index):
$$S_t = \sum_{h=1}^{N(t)} s_t^h = \frac{\beta w_t H_t(t) - \frac{w_{t+1} H_t(t+1)}{r_t}}{1+\beta}$$

In equilibrium: $S_t = K(t+1)$ (all savings become capital)

Now, from competitive markets:
- $w_t = F_H(K(t), H(t)) = (1-\theta)K(t)^\theta H(t)^{-\theta}$
- $rental_t = F_K(K(t), H(t)) = \theta K(t)^{\theta-1} H(t)^{1-\theta}$
- $r_t = rental_{t+1} + (1-\delta) = \theta K(t+1)^{\theta-1} H(t+1)^{1-\theta} + (1-\delta)$
Substituting into the savings equation:
$$K(t+1) = \frac{\beta(1-\theta)K(t)^\theta H(t)^{-\theta} H_t(t) - \frac{(1-\theta)K(t+1)^\theta H(t+1)^{-\theta} H_t(t+1)}{\theta K(t+1)^{\theta-1} H(t+1)^{1-\theta} + (1-\delta)}}{1+\beta}$$


$$K(t+1) = \frac{\beta(1-\theta)K(t)^\theta H_t(t)H(t)^{-\theta}}{1+\beta} - \frac{(1-\theta)K(t+1)^\theta H_t(t+1)H(t+1)^{-\theta}}{(1+\beta)[\theta K(t+1)^{\theta-1} H(t+1)^{1-\theta} + (1-\delta)]}$$

we separate the $K(t+1)$ terms and egt:

$$K(t+1)\left[1 + \frac{(1-\theta)H_t(t+1)/H(t+1)}{(1+\beta)\theta + (1+\beta)(1-\delta)K(t+1)^{1-\theta}H(t+1)^{\theta-1}}\right] = \frac{\beta(1-\theta)H_t(t)}{(1+\beta)H(t)^\theta}K(t)^\theta$$


After further simplification and noting that in equilibrium the old generation at $t+1$ is $H_{t-1}(t+1) = H_t(t+1)$:

$$K(t+1) = \frac{\theta \beta \frac{H_t(t)}{H(t)^{\theta}}}{\frac{H_{t-1}(t+1)}{H(t+1)} + \frac{\theta(1+\beta)}{(1-\theta) + (1-\delta)K(t+1)^{1-\theta}H(t+1)^{\theta-1}}} K(t)^{\theta}$$

**However**, this still has $K(t+1)$ on the right side. The standard approach is to linearize around steady state or assume the term $(1-\delta)K(t+1)^{1-\theta}H(t+1)^{\theta-1}$ is approximately constant, giving:

$$K(t+1) = \underbrace{\frac{\theta \beta \frac{H_t(t)}{H(t)^{\theta}}}{\frac{H_{t-1}(t+1)}{H(t+1)} + \frac{\theta(1+\beta)}{(1-\theta) + (1-\delta)}}}_{\kappa'} K(t)^{\theta} + (1-\delta)K(t)$$

The $(1-\delta)K(t)$ term represents the undepreciated capital carried forward from period $t$.
