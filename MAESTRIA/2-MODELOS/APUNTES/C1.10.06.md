- Measuring technology in
- WW2 and Technology. Jaoan, Germany weere destroyed, steeel mills rebuilding with newer more eficient methods than US who didnt want to throw out already built technology

### Reduced form: 
various equations 

Friedman -> that way cant explain intertemporal and intratemporal smoothing. 

De la Rua: 10% impuesto a los autos, x 6 meses : expectations -> sales tank, less output 

### Recursive
Optimal Contral (Kolmogorov Pontyagrin)
Prescott 
Bellman - Variational methods (easier)


### Approximations
log linearization vs non linear approximation with chebychev polynomials


## RBC = DSGE
Prescott Kydland - solving lucas critique
Model taking into account lucas - expectations , preferences , persistnece
utility over 3 periods
capital accumulated gradually , no tall can be used immediately , : Time To Build (for persisntence) - reducing capital today reduced capital tomorrow 
Its solutions technique are linear . 
Linearizarion : from the beginnngeing , turn utility into matrix  : linear quesratic roblem. constrants are linear, optimizaiton is quadratic. the FOCs are linear. So everything is linear. KP linearized their model.

other way: optimize , get FOCs and then linearize those

Credit models imply a philips curve .

Sargent .: learning models 

Bounded Rationality

### Approximations
Tayllor y actualy projections: 
- take nonlinear, get a contant, the derivative (get the coefficient of the cubic, etc)
with more expansions, the 

Chebychev polynomials dont explode as taylor . they are all perpendicular. the steps in taylor are  correlated. Chebychev always adds Information


### Successful RBC|DSGE model
- Capture second moments: change in output or consumptions (good in the first models). 
- Getting correlations - even better
- Impulse responses
