### 1.
Represent the following strategic situation as an extensive-form game. Janet is a contestant on a popular game show, and her task is to guess behind which door Liz, another contestant, is standing. With Janet out of the room, Liz chooses a door behind which to stand—either door A or door B. The host, Monty, observes this choice. Janet, not having observed Liz’s choice, then enters the room. Monty says to Janet either “Red” or “Green” (which sounds silly, of course, but it is a silly game show). After hearing Monty’s statement, Janet picks a door (she says either “A” or “B”). If she picks the correct door, then she wins $100. If she picks the wrong door, then she wins nothing. Liz wins $100 if Janet picks the wrong door and nothing if she picks the correct door. (Thus, Liz would like to hide from Janet, and Janet would like to find Liz.) Monty likes the letter A. If Janet selects door A, then this selection makes Monty happy to the tune of 10 units of utility. If she selects door B, then Monty receives 0 utility units.

### 2.
Consider the following strategic situation concerning the owner of a firm (O), the manager of the firm (M), and a potential worker (W). The owner first decides whether to hire the worker, to refuse to hire the worker, or to let the manager make the decision. If the owner lets the manager make the decision, then the manager must choose between hiring the worker or not hiring the worker. If the worker is hired, then he or she chooses between working diligently and shirking. Assume that the worker does not know whether he or she was hired by the manager or the owner when he or she makes this decision. If the worker is not hired, then all three players get a payoff of 0. If the worker is hired and shirks, then the owner and man- ager each get a payoff of −1, whereas the worker gets 1. If the worker is hired by the owner and works diligently, then the owner gets a payoff of 1, the manager gets 0, and the worker gets 0. If the worker is hired by the manager and works diligently, then the owner gets 0, the manager gets 1, and the worker gets 1. Represent this game in the extensive form (draw the game tree).

### 3.
Draw the extensive form for the following game (invent your own payoff vectors, because I give you no payoff information). There is an industry in which two firms compete as follows: First, firm 1 decides whether to set a high price (H) or a low price (L). After seeing firm 1’s price, firm 2 decides whether to set a high price (H) or a low price (L). If both firms selected the low price, then the game ends with no further interaction. If either or both firms selected the high price, then the attorney general decides whether to prosecute (P) or not (N) for anticompetitive behavior. In this case, the attorney general does not observe which firm selected the high price (or if both firms selected the high price).

### 4.
The following game is routinely played by youngsters—and adults as well—throughout the world. Two players simultaneously throw their right arms up and down to the count of “one, two, three.” (Nothing strategic happens as they do this.) On the count of three, each player quickly forms his or her hand into the shape of either a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. Abbreviate these shapes as R, P, and S, respectively. The players make this choice at the same time. If the players pick the same shape, then the game ends in a tie. Otherwise, one of the players wins and the other loses. The winner is determined by the following rule: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Each player obtains a payoff of 1 if he or she wins, −1 if he or she loses, and 0 if he or she ties. Represent this game in the extensive form. Also discuss the relevance of the order of play (which of the players has the move at the initial node) in the extensive form.

No es importante qué jugador está en el primer nodo, los dos tienen el mismo set de información
### 5.
Consider the following strategic setting. There are three people: Amy, Bart, and Chris. Amy and Bart have hats. These three people are arranged in a room so that Bart can see everything that Amy does, Chris can see everything that Bart does, but the players can see nothing else. In particular, Chris cannot see what Amy does. First, Amy chooses either to put her hat on her head (abbreviated by H) or on the floor (F). After observing Amy’s move, Bart chooses between putting his hat on his head or on the floor. If Bart puts his hat on his head, the game ends and everyone gets a payoff of 0. If Bart puts his hat on the floor, then Chris must guess whether Amy’s hat is on her head by saying either “yes” or “no.” This ends the game. If Chris guesses correctly, then he gets a payoff of 1 and Amy gets a payoff of −1. If he guesses incorrectly, then these payoffs are reversed. Bart’s payoff is 0, regardless of what happens. Represent this game in the extensive form (draw the game tree).
![[C2_5.png|400]]
### 6.
Represent the following game in the extensive form. There are three players, numbered 1, 2, and 3. At the beginning of the game, players 1 and 2 simultaneously make decisions, each choosing between “X” and “Y.” If they both choose “X,” then the game ends and the payoff vector is (1, 0, 0); that is, player 1 gets 1, player 2 gets 0, and player 3 gets 0. If they both choose “Y,” then the game ends and the payoff vector is (0, 1, 0); that is, player 2 gets 1 and the other players get 0. If one player chooses “X” while the other chooses “Y,” then player 3 must guess which of the players selected “X”; that is, player 3 must choose between “1” and “2.” Player 3 makes his selection knowing only that the game did not end after the choices of players 1 and 2. If player 3 guesses correctly, then he and the player who selected “X” each obtains a payoff of 2, and the player who selected “Y” gets 0. If player 3 guesses incorrectly, then everyone gets a payoff of 0.

### 7.
Draw the extensive-form diagram for the following strategic setting. There are three people: Amy, Bart, and Chris. Amy and Bart each have two cards, one of which has “K” (for King) written on it and the other has “Q” (for Queen) written on it; that is, Amy and Bart both have a King and a Queen. At the beginning of the game, Amy must place one of her cards (either K or Q) into an envelope and then give the envelope to Bart. Bart sees the card that Amy placed into the envelope, and then he places one of his cards (either K or Q) into the envelope as well. The envelope is then given to Chris, who has not observed the moves of Amy and Bart. Chris opens the envelope. Chris sees the two cards inside, but she does not know which card was placed there by Amy and which card was deposited by Bart. After ob- serving the contents of the envelope, Chris selects “yes” (Y) or “no” (N). If Chris selects Y and Amy had put a King in the envelope, then Amy and Bart each get a payoff of 0 and Chris gets 1. If Chris selects N and Amy had put a Queen in the envelope, then, again, Amy and Bart each get a payoff of 0 and Chris gets 1. In all other outcomes, Amy and Bart each get a payoff of 1 and Chris gets 0.1

### 8.
Consider the following strategic setting. There are three players, numbered 1, 2, and 3. Player 1 has two cards, labeled King and Ace. At the beginning of the game, player 1 deals one of the cards to player 2 and the other card to player 3; that is, player 1 either gives the Ace to player 3 and the King to player 2 (call this the action A) or the King to player 3 and the Ace to player 2 (action K). Player 2 observes the card dealt to him; player 3 does not get to see the card dealt to her. Player 2 then must decide between switching cards with player 3 (S) or not (N). Player 3 observes whether player 2 made the switch, but does not see her card. Finally, player 3 responds to the question “Is your card the Ace?” by saying either “yes” (Y) or “no” (N). If player 3 correctly states whether her card is the Ace, then she obtains a payoff of 1 and the other players get 0; otherwise, players 1 and 2 both get a payoff of 1 and player 3 obtains 0. Represent this game in the extensive form.

Suppose a manager and a worker interact as follows. The manager decides whether to hire or not hire the worker. If the manager does not hire the worker, then the game ends. When hired, the worker chooses to exert either high effort or low effort. On observing the worker’s effort, the manager chooses to retain or fire the worker. In this game, does “not hire” describe a strategy for the manager? Explain

### 5. 
Consider a version of the Cournot duopoly game, which will be thoroughly analyzed in Chapter 10. Two firms (1 and 2) compete in a homogeneous goods market, where the firms produce exactly the same good. The firms simultaneously and independently select quantities to produce. The quantity selected by firm i is denoted $q_{i}$ and must be greater than or equal to zero, for i = 1, 2. The market price is given by $p = 2 − q_{1} − q_{2}$. For simplicity, assume that the cost to firm i of producing any quantity is zero. Further, assume that each firm’s payoff is defined as its profit. That is, firm i’s payoff is $pq_{i}$ , where j denotes firm i’s opponent in the game. Describe the normal form of this game by expressing the strategy spaces and writing the payoffs as functions of the strategies.

max profit 1: $max_{q_{1}}  p·q_{1} =( 2 − q_{1} − q_{2} )q_{1}=( 2q_{1} − q_{1}^{2} − q_{2}q_{1} )$ 

Estrategias:
$S_{1}=q_{1}\in[0, \infty]$
$S_{2}=q_{2}\in[0, \infty]$

Payoffs:
$u_{1}= 2s_{1} − s_{1}^{2} − s_{2}s_{1}$
$u_{2}= 2s_{2} − s_{2}^{2} − s_{2}s_{1}$

Forma normal
$\Gamma_{N}=[2, \{q_{1}, q_{2}\}, \{ ( 2s_{1} − s_{1}^{2} − s_{2}s_{1} ), ( 2s_{2} − s_{2}^{2} − s_{2}s_{1} )\}]$
### 6.
Consider a variation of the Cournot duopoly game in which the firms move sequentially rather than simultaneously. Suppose that firm 1 selects its quantity first. After observing firm 1’s selection, firm 2 chooses its quantity. This is called the von Stackelberg duopoly model. For this game, describe what a strategy of firm 2 must specify. An exercise in Chapter 16 asks you to analyze this game.

Cada estrategia de firm 2 es definida por la función:
$q_{1} \in [0,\infty]$
$q_{2} \in [0,\infty]$

$S_{2}:q_{1}\to q_{2}$
$S_{2}:[0,\infty]\to[0,\infty]$

Consider the following strategic setting involving a cat named Baker, a mouse named Cheezy, and a dog named Spike. Baker’s objective is to catch Cheezy while avoiding Spike; Cheezy wants to tease Baker but avoid get- ting caught; Spike wants to rest and is unhappy when he is disturbed. In the morning, Baker and Cheezy simultaneously decide what activity to engage in. Baker can either nap (N) or hunt (H), where hunting involves moving Spike’s bone. Cheezy can either hide (h) or play (p). If nap and hide are chosen, then the game ends. The game also will end immediately if hunt and play are chosen, in which case Baker captures Cheezy. On the other hand, if nap and play are chosen, then Cheezy observes that Baker is napping and must decide whether to move Spike’s bone (m) or not (n). If he chooses to not move the bone, then the game ends. Finally, in the event that Spike’s bone was moved (either by Baker choosing to hunt or by Cheezy moving it later), then Spike learns that his bone was moved but does not observe who moved it; in this contingency, Spike must choose whether to punish Baker (B) or punish Cheezy (J). After Spike moves, the game ends. In this game, how many information sets are there for Cheezy? How many strategy profiles are there in this game?

Evaluate the following payoffs for the game given by the normal form pictured here. Remember, a mixed strategy for player 1 is $s_{1}\in\Delta\{U,M,D\}$, where $\sigma_{1}(U)$ is the probability that player 1 plays strategy U, and so forth. For simplicity, we write $\sigma_{1}$ as $(\sigma_{1}(U), \sigma_{1}(M), \sigma_{1}(D))$, and similarly for player 2.

### 2. 
Suppose we have a game where S1 = {H, L} and S2 = {X, Y}. If player 1 plays H, then her payoff is z regardless of player 2’s choice of strategy; player 1’s other payoff numbers are u1(L, X) = 0 and u1(L, Y) = 10. You may choose any payoff numbers you like for player 2 because we will only be concerned with player 1’s payoff.

(a) Draw the normal form of this game.

(b) If player 1’s belief is $\theta_{2}$ = (1/2, 1/2), what is player 1’s expected payoff of playing H? What is his expected payoff of playing L? For what value of z is player 1 indifferent between playing H and L? 

$u_{1}(H, \theta_{2})=\frac{1}{2} · z+\frac{1}{2}·z=z$
$u_{1}(L, \theta_{2})=\frac{1}{2}·0+\frac{1}{2}·10=5$

### 5.
Consider a version of the Cournot duopoly game, where firms 1 and 2 simultaneously and independently select quantities to produce in a market. The quantity selected by firm i is denoted qi and must be greater than or equal to zero, for i = 1, 2. The market price is given by $p = 100 − 2q_{1} − 2q_{2}$. Suppose that each firm produces at a cost of 20 per unit. Further, assume that each firm’s payoff is defined as its profit. (If you completed Exercise 5 of Chapter 3, then you have already dealt with this type of game.) Suppose that player 1 has the belief that player 2 is equally likely to select each of the quantities 6, 11, and 13. What is player 1’s expected payoff of choosing a quantity of 14?

max profit 1: $max_{q_{1}}  p·q_{1} - c=( 100 − 2q_{1} − 2q_{2} )q_{1}-c= 100q_{1} − 2q_{1}²− 2q_{2}q_{1}-20$ 
$\theta=$
$p(q_{2}=6)=\frac{1}{3}$
$p(q_{2}=11)=\frac{1}{3}$
$p(q_{2}=13)=\frac{1}{3}$

Payoffs:
$u_{1}(q_{1}, \theta) = \frac{1}{3} [100q_{1} − 2q_{1}²− 2·6·q_{1}-20] +\frac{1}{3}[100q_{1} − 2q_{1}²− 2·11·q_{1}-20] + \frac{1}{3} [100q_{1} − 2q_{1}²− 2·13·q_{1}-20]$
 $u_{1}(14,\theta)=$ 1/3 * (100 * 14 - 2 * 14^2 - 2 * 6 * 14 -20)+   1/3 * (100 * 14 - 2 * 14^2 - 2 * 11 * 14 -20)  + 1/3 * (100 * 14 - 2 * 14^2 - 2 * 13 * 14 -20) = 707.99

En una estrategia pura una estrategia sola tiene $w=1$ y el resto 0. 
La pregunta dice entonces is alguna de las estrategias por si sola debe ser mayor o igual a 5.
Es un tema básico de promedios: para que el la media ponderada de $n$ números sea en este caso 5, alguno de los componentes debe ser igual o mayor a 5.

u_{i}(s_{i},\theta_{-i})=5 \implies u_{i}(s_{i}, \theta_{-i}) ≥ 5
$$
$$
A \implies B
$$
es lo mismo que demostrar

$$
B \implies not A
$$
