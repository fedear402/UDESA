From 1989 to 1999, Carlos Menem, affiliated with the Peronist party, served as the President of Argentina. Traditionally, the Peronist party was known for its support of labor unions, the economically disadvantaged, and policies like protectionism and income redistribution. However, during Menem's presidency, Argentina took a turn towards neoliberalism. This shift included opening its markets to international competition, cutting back on state employment and welfare benefits, and accepting higher unemployment rates. Despite these changes, the party managed to maintain the support of many of its working-class followers.

In "Poor People’s Politics," Javier Auyero explores how the Peronist party managed to retain its base amidst such drastic policy shifts. He attributes this to the personal intervention of party organizers, deeply embedded within poor communities, who addressed the immediate, practical needs of the people. These Peronist "brokers" would provide essential services like free medication, distribute food, and find jobs for those in need, such as unemployed youths or widows in distress. The key to Peronism's resilience, Auyero argues, lies in the politics of clientelism. This system didn't explicitly trade favors for votes or rally attendance. Instead, it fostered a sense of obligation among beneficiaries, leading them to believe that losing a Peronist leader like the local mayor could end the provision of these essential services.

Auyero's analysis is based on a year-long ethnographic study in Villa Paraíso, a group of neighborhoods in Co´spito, located in the impoverished outskirts of Buenos Aires. He discusses the broader historical and economic backdrop of Argentina's shift from industrialization and the resulting challenges faced by communities like Villa Paraíso. Through detailed ethnography, Auyero reveals how Peronist brokers, local mobilizers, and mayoral staff selectively distribute resources to garner support. He also delves into the public "performances" of Peronism and the crucial role played by female operatives, who often see themselves as selfless figures in the mold of Eva Perón, the revered wife of the party's founder.

Further, Auyero examines the perspective of those on the receiving end of clientelism, noting a spectrum of attitudes from skepticism to a felt obligation towards the party. This variance, he suggests, depends on how close individuals are to the brokers' inner circles. He contrasts the historical significance of Peronism with its contemporary role, post-Menem, concluding that personalized problem-solving through clientelism is key to understanding the party's enduring support among the poor. Auyero emphasizes that this is more than just a political transaction; it's based on a deeply ingrained belief that personal political intervention is vital for solving pressing issues.

While the study offers rich insights, it is not without its flaws. Auyero occasionally lapses into complex jargon and, at times, the limitations of focusing narrowly on a small group of participants become apparent. For example, his claims about women identifying with Eva Perón, based on interviews with just two individuals, might appear to generalize unfairly. Furthermore, while Auyero's discussion of clientelism is thought-provoking, it leaves unanswered questions about why political rivals don't simply outbid the Peronist brokers or why constituents don't accept goods but vote based on government performance instead. Despite these criticisms, Auyero's work provides a deep and nuanced understanding of Peronist clientelism, even if it doesn't fully address the complexities and potential weaknesses of such a system.
